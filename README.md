Learning Data Science
Welcome to my Data Science learning journey! In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn more about this exciting field.

What I'm Learning
Currently, I'm focusing on the basics of Data Science, including:

Data analysis with Python and pandas
Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
Machine learning with scikit-learn
I'm also exploring related topics such as statistics, probability, and data cleaning.
